In addition to the provided Product Overview, we need these features with associated priorities:

## High Priority
* We would like an intuitive User Interface that a checker can use easily and effectively with minimal training.
* We would like the ability to get an output that is readable, and can be imported into Microsoft Excel
* We would like to be able to generate weekly sales and profit reports.
* We need a method of inputting sale prices
* We also need a ‘manager override’ such that if a product is mislabeled, we can override the product’s price. This should be noted on the transaction report

## Medium Priority
* We want (semi) automatic purchase orders as needed for products, based on a goal inventory and separated based on supplier. The goal inventory should be specified and changeable in a management interface.
* We need every transaction to be saved in a database, searchable by a unique transaction ID (Such as a receipt for a cart of items)- We also want this to output in a verified format (PDF or similar)
* We need a method of reassessing/refreshing our inventory in the case of spoiled/stolen items.
* We want to be able to search and sort products by:
   * ID
   * Name
   * Type of Product in a Hierarchy (Food>Fruit>Banana, or Food>Meat)
   * Supplier
   * Retail Price
   * Purchase Price
   * Current/Goal Inventory

## Low Priority
* We should be able to have spoilage and expiration accounted for
* User modes- Managers should have their own interface for product orders and such, but clerks shouldn’t need to deal with accidental/mysterious buttons.
   * Additionally, we should be able to verify that a manager is in fact a manager. (password or management ID or something.) Possibly be able to tell which manager as well.
