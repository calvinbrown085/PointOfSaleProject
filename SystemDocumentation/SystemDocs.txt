This is the system documentation for our POS System. It will cover all the files in our system and go one by one and describing what they do.

In the root directory you will find these files that contribute to our project.

Database.py -
Overview: This is the Database class that we use throughout the project that connects our code to the database, we are using heroku's database tools
to connect this class to the DB

Use Cases:
We have our Get queries. These queries get information from the database, and don't write any information from the database. They are
named exactly what they are supposed to do.

We have our User queries, these queries interact with user data and can write and read information from the database.

We have our Insert queries, these queries insert information into the database, it will write transaction, and put new information into
the database.

We have our Update queries, these queries don't insert any new rows into the database, but they will update existing rows in the
database.

DatabaseUrlGenerator.py -
Overview: This file will get the database url for local development and for production development so we don't have that in our codebase

Use Cases:
getLines(): This will get database info from a local text file, only used for local development

getDatabaseUrl(): This will grab the database url locally text file and is used for local development

DbConnection.py -
Overview: This is the code that handles the connecting to the database. This is a pretty simple interaction.
This class is only used in the Database.py class, it allows for that class to connect to the database on Heroku.

Use Cases:
There are only 2 use cases for this class:

readQuery, this function is used for the get queries in Database.py, it gives us information back from the database in python List form.

writeQuery, this function doesn't return anything because it is used for insert and update queries in Database.py.

These are only supposed to be used in Database.py class.


DatabaseUtils.py -
Overview: This is a file that holds a lot of logic and utilities away from the queries and the main file.

Use Cases:

getTotalPrice, this will get the total price for the items in the users cart it is used in the main.py file.

newCustomer, this will write a name and an email to the database.

newTransaction, this will write a new transaction to the database with a random transaction id associated with it.

listToString, this function will take the list of items from the cart and make them a list for transactions inserting.

createSale, this function will create a sale from the manager page and do the appropriate things in the database.

moneyMadeFromProduct, this function will calculate the money made from each product in your inventory. Available from the manager page.

generateReport, this will create a report of all the items in the database with the moneyMadeFromProduct on them.

purchasedItems, this function will subtract purchased items from the inventory_log when someone buys something from the inventory.

addToSearchQuery, this adds things to the cashiers search query.

addToManagerSearchQuery, this will do the same thing as above but for the manager only.

main.py -
Overview: This is the brain of our program. It handles all the internet requests, and handles all of the routes for the system.
All of the program connects to the main.

Use Cases: Its hard to gauge use cases for this function since none of its functions can really be called but we will still go over what they do.
We will be covering what the routes do.

@app.route("/managerPage")
This route will take us to the manager page and will render that page and pass all necessary inputs in.

@app.route("/searchInventoryById", methods=["POST"])
This route will ask the database class for its method getById and grabs a product id passed and gives back the row of information
containing that product id.

@app.route("/searchInventoryByName", methods=["POST"])
This route will ask the database class for its method getByName and grabs a name passed and gives back the row(s) of information
containing that product name.

@app.route("/searchEmailsByName", methods=["POST"])
This route will ask the database class for its method getUser and grabs an email passed and gives back the row of information
containing that user.

@app.route("/login", methods=["GET","POST"])
Uses the user login package to log a user in and create the session objects for that user.

@app.route("/logout")
This route will log the user out and clear their session objects

@app.route("/pos")
This route will render the pos.html template and gets passed all necessary inputs.

@app.route("/cart", methods=["POST"])
This method is a little more complicated, This method takes in input from the cashier, which is the product id. Looks that product up in the
database, then adds it to the screen where the user and cashier can see their total amount. This also keeps track of what is in the
users cart.


@app.route("/checkout")
This method leads the cashier from the cart to the checkout page. This route renders the checkout page

@app.route("/methodOfPayment")
Here we have the last method for the cashier to hit, this method will accept a form of payment for the items on the checkout page. After
the cashier has entered payment it will clear the cart and the total for the current person.

@app.route("/search")
This method will take input from the user and search the database for what the user is looking by
Possible search queries are:
price
product_id
product name
supplier
It will return what the database finds in the table on the POS page


@app.route("/profitReport")
This method does pretty much what it says. It gives back a profit report of all the items in the inventory.

@app.route("/managerSearch")
This does the same thing as before, but it searches the database for the manager.

@app.route("/createSale")
This will create sales and lower or give price decreases on products in the database. Only the manager can access this functionality.


UserLoginPackage.py -
Overview: This code allows us to make users and create session objects for those users and allow them to log in and use the system.

The login html is used when a get request is sent to the /login endpoint

loginErrorHtml is thrown when someone enters bad credentials

Use Cases/Functions:
requireLogin: This function can be called to make someone log in before accessing parts of the system, keeping it secure so not just anyone can access it

requireManagerLogin: This function can be called where a manager is supposed to log in and it makes sure a manager is logging in not just a cashier.

logout: This function logs both managers and cashiers out, it clears all session objects associated with them as well.

login: This function is used to log a user in and it will check the username and the password to make sure they are both correct and in the db, it will then
When you visit the site a session object is created for you, this login method sets keys to be used later in the program.



script.py -
Overview: This code allows us to run tests before deploying our production environment. It makes sure there are no errors in anything we have coded before giving it to the
customer.

Use Cases:

getCreds, this function will get the credentials for local testing. 

client, this will send a request to our site to make sure its up and working

test_client, makes sure the login page pops up when we access the site.

test_inventory, makes sure the inventory endpoint gives something back when we hit it.

test_pos, hits the pos page to make sure its up and running.

test_logout, makes sure the logout endpoint is up and running.



Database Information(Data) - Our database is also hosted on heroku, it is accessed through our code using psycopg2.
