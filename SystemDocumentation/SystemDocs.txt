This is the system documentation for our POS System. It will cover all the files in our system one by one and telling what they do.

Database.py -
Overview: This is the Database class that we use throughout the project that connects our code to the database, we are using heroku's database tools
to connect this class to the DB

Use Cases:
We have our Get queries. These queries get information from the database, and don't write any information from the database. They are
named exactly what they are supposed to do.

We have our User queries, these queries interact with user data and can write and read information from the database.

We have our Insert queries, these queries insert information into the database, it will write transaction, and put new information into
the database.

We have our Update queries, these queries don't insert any new rows into the database, but they will update existing rows in the
database.



DbConnection.py -
Overview: This is the code that handles the returning and connecting to the URL of the database. This is a pretty simple interaction.
This class is only used in the Database.py class, it allows for that class to connect to the database on Heroku.

Use Cases:
There are only 2 use cases for this class:

readQuery, this function is used for the get queries in Database.py, it gives us information back from the database in python List form.

writeQuery, this function doesn't return anything because it is used for insert and update queries in Database.py.

These are only supposed to be used in Database.py class.
